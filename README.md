# Creating A Token

## Through the use of this code, you will be able to:

* Create their own ERC-20 token.
* Use the mint function to issue new tokens to specific addresses.
* Use the burn function to reduce the token supply by removing tokens held by specific addresses
* Ensure the balance check prevents burning more tokens than are present in the supply.

## Overview 
PURPOSE: The contract aims to create a basic ERC-20 token with functionalities for minting and burning tokens. 
Developers can use this code as an example or a foundation to learn how they can deploy their own custom tokens on the Ethereum network. 


## Getting Started

### Where to run?

You may run this code on https://remix.ethereum.org/

### Executing program

First, you should check the version of solidity being used. Click the Solidity Compiler tab, then check if you're using the right version; proceed to this and click compile. There is an option to auto compile if you wish to use it.

Once you have compiled it successfully, you can deploy the code through the Deploy & Run Transactions tab

We can then go down and expand on the token that is deployed by first copying the address from the Account box above to the _sender boxes under burn, mint, and balances.
Make sure to input the same address you inputted in the balances variable and type in the value you want to add to the mint function or deduct on the burn function.
